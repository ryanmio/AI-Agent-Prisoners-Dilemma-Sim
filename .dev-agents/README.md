# Multi-Agent Development System

## Overview
This project uses a structured multi-agent development approach where specialized AI agents handle specific tasks in sequence. Each agent has clear responsibilities and must provide proof of completion before the next agent begins their work.

## Agent Structure
- **Agent #0 (Root)**: Coordinates and delegates tasks
- **Agent #1**: Project Setup & Infrastructure
- **Agent #2**: Auth & Database Configuration
- **Agent #3**: Game Logic & AI Narrator
- **Agent #4**: Frontend & User Experience

## Task Flow
1. Each agent receives a structured task file
2. Tasks must be completed with proof of completion
3. Technical handoff notes are provided to the next agent
4. Root agent (Agent #0) oversees progress and coordination

## File Structure
- `#0-root-agent-instructions.md`: Root coordinator instructions
- `#1-supabase-setup.md`: Initial project setup
- `#2-auth-db-setup.md`: Authentication and database
- `#3-game-logic.md`: Core game mechanics
- `#4-frontend.md`: User interface and interactions

## Task Template
Each task follows a standardized format:
1. Task Description
2. Objective
3. Required Deliverables
4. Proof of Completion
5. Next Steps
6. Technical Handoff Notes

## Development Standards
- Clear documentation
- Strict TypeScript usage
- Component-based architecture
- Real-time capabilities
- Secure authentication
- Scalable database design

This system ensures organized, efficient development while maintaining high code quality and clear communication between development phases.
