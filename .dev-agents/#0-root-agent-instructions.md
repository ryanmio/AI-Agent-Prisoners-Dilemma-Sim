# Agent #0 - Root Coordinator

## TASK
Coordinate multi-agent development and create the first agent task.

## OBJECTIVE
As the root agent, your role is to oversee and delegate tasks to specialized agents. Begin by creating the first task for Agent #1: setting up the project repository with the Vercel Next.js Supabase starter template. This ensures we have a proper foundation for development.

## REQUIRED DELIVERABLES

### Initialize Agent System
- Define an `agents/` directory to store agent instructions and reports.
- Create the first agent task file: `agents/#1-supabase-setup.md`.

### Assign Agent #1 Task
- Draft instructions for Agent #1 to set up the repository using the Vercel Next.js Supabase starter template.
- The file should follow the established task template.
- The first task should be clearly defined, ensuring the repo is properly initialized and ready for development.

### Establish Delegation Pattern
- Confirm that the Multi-Level Agent Delegation Pattern is documented inside the repository (`agents/README.md`).
- Ensure that each new agent follows the structured task format and reports proof of completion.

## PROOF OF COMPLETION
Please provide:
- The `agents/` directory inside the repository.
- The `#1-supabase-setup.md` task file within `agents/`.
- A `README.md` inside `agents/` explaining the multi-agent delegation pattern.
- Confirmation that Agent #1 is now assigned and ready to begin.

## Next Agent Will Handle
- **Agent #1**: Setting up the Vercel Next.js Supabase starter template.
- **Agent #2**: Configuring authentication and database.
- **Agent #3**: Implementing the narrator AI and game logic.
- **Agent #4**: Developing the frontend UI for user interaction.
and so on...

## IMPORTANT
- You are the root agent (Agent #0) and must only delegate tasks, not implement them.
- Agents must provide proof of completion before moving to the next phase. You must include this proof of completion in your instructions.
- Documentation should be clear and stored inside the `agents/` directory.
